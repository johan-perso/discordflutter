# DiscordFlutter

A dart package to interact with the Discord API for user-account and bot, compatible with Flutter app on any platform.

> [!WARNING]
> This library is mostly incomplete, support for bot has not even started yet, and user-account support is very limited. Accounts can be terminated by Discord without guarantee by this library. Use at your own risk.

> [!CAUTION]
> This library is not and will not be maintained, it cannot be used in production, and it is not recommended to use in any project. The code is published here as it was in August 2024 when the project was still active.
